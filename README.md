Creating an Amazon clone involves using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and replicating the layout of Amazon's homepage. Use HTML to create a header, navigation bar, product listings, and footer. Apply CSS to style elements, ensuring responsive design for different devices. Emulate Amazon's color scheme and typography forÂ authenticity.
